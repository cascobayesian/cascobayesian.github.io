:::{#hero-heading}

Welcome! This is the academic website for Jack O'Brien. I'm an applied statistician and data scientist as well as a professor of statistics at Bowdoin College. In addition to teaching, I spend most of my time thinking about how different types of social science data (pottery shards, election results, tweets) can be integrated to create complex portraits of social phenomena. I'm particularly interested in creating low-dimensional representation of long-standing cultural forms.



## Experience

- Associate Professor, Bowdoin College
- Assistant Professor, Bowdoin College
- Senior Statistician, Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford

## Education

- BA, Pomona College (Mathematics)
- PhD, UCLA (Biomathematics)

## Recent work
Check out my recent(ish) paper using mixture models to map political ideology using election data: [O'Brien. 2025. "A Bayesian mixture model captures temporal and spatial structure of voting blocs within longitudinal referendum data"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01677). Current in press in *Political Science Research and Methods*.
