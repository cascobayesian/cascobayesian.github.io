Welcome! This is the academic website of Jack O'Brien. I'm an applied statistician, data scientist, and a professor of mathematics at [Bowdoin College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowdoin_College). In addition to teaching, I spend most of my time thinking about how mixture models and related approaches can be used to analyze social science data ([pottery sherds](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/rspb/article/283/1827/20152824/84418/Mixture-model-of-pottery-decorations-from-Lake), [election results](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01677), [tweets](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0038038520956940)) to create remarkably simple portraits of complex social phenomena. Recently, I have been thinking a lot about how to connect these methods to the [Bayesian multiview problem](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.13484). I'm currently at work using these techniques to map

## Recent work
* (**Dec 2025**) Check out my recent(ish) paper using mixture models to map political ideology using election data: [O'Brien. 2025. "A Bayesian mixture model captures temporal and spatial structure of voting blocs within longitudinal referendum data"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01677). Currently in press in *Political Science Research and Methods*.
* (**Dec 2025**) My two honors students, Avery Cutler and Nathan Kellerman, made absolutely amazing mid-year presentations on their respective projects. Check out their projects here: [Avery's on modeling eviction records in Boston] and [Nathan's work on a new EM algorithm for overdispersed count data](https://github.com/nathan-kellerman/nkellerman-research-git).
* (**July 2025**) Very happy to see Assistant Professor of Physics Fe McBride's paper, ["A radio-quiet AGN as a candidate counterpart to neutrino event IceCube–200615A"](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/541/2/1613/8175000) (on which I made a very small assist) published in *The Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society*.
