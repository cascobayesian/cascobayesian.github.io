[Spring 2026](https://cascobayesian.github.io/Computational.Hermeneutics/)

An intensive survey of the practice and principles of statistical modeling. Over the course of the semester, we'll be: (1) learning how to build statistical models; (2) learning how to interpret their results from real data sets, and (3) repeating that in as many ways and contexts as we can possibly squeeze in during our time together. Consequently, we'll be taking a brisk (but thorough!) tour of many of the workhorses of computational statistics: simulation, parametric models, testing, regression (in its myriad forms), model selection, and clustering. We'll consider data from municipal hate crimes, speed dating experiments, astronomical surveys, criminal sentencing, immigration processes, and the Titanic disaster to give students an intensive exposure to the extraordinary power and many dangers of statistical reasoning. 

Though a comprehensive review is provided, the pace of the material very much assumes a previous course in probability. No coding experience is assumed but for those with truly no experience a lighter schedule for the semester might be wise. As a final project, students will present  a set of models for a data set of their choosing.
