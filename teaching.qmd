[Spring 2026](cascobayesian.github.io)

An advanced introduction to the practice and principles of statistical modeling, or how to build statistical models to interpret data in as many contexts as we can possibly squeeze into a semester. Topics make for a breathy, tour de force of the core workhorses of statistics: simulation, parametric models, inference, testing,  regression in its myriad forms, and, hopefully, clustering. Along the way, we'll consider data from a wide array of sources -- speed dating experiments, teaching evaluations, hate crimes, criminal sentencing, plague deaths, historical debates on colonialism, and the Titanic itself -- to give students a wide exposure to different interpretive domains. Throughout the semester, we will collaboratively fashion the tools each student will need to construct their own final data project, an extensive exploration of a dataset of their choosing. Assumes a course in probability and an enthusiasm for coding.
