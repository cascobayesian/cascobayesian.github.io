*“In all the works on pedagogy that ever I read ... I don't remember that any one has advocated a system of teaching by practical jokes, mostly cruel. That, however, describes the method of our great teacher, Experience.”* -Charles Pierce

[Spring 2026](https://cascobayesian.github.io/Computational.Hermeneutics/)

An advanced introduction to the practice and principles of statistical modeling. In practice this means we will be: (1) learning how to build statistical models; (2) learning how to interpret their results from real data sets, and (3) repeating that in as many contexts as we can possibly squeeze into a semester. We'll take a galloping tour of many of the workhorses of computational statistics and machine learning: simulation, parametric models, inference, testing,  regression (in its myriad forms), and clustering. Along the way, we'll consider data from across the modern experience -- university teaching evaluations, municipal hate crimes, speed dating experiments, astronomical surveys, criminal sentencing, immigration processes, the Atlantic slave trade, and the Titanic disaster -- to give students wide exposure to different interpretive examples for squaring up statistical results with the complex, ambiguous messiness of human understanding. Through the semester, we will collaboratively fashion the tools each student will need to construct their final data project, the elaboration of a statistical model for a data set of their choosing. Course material very much assumes a course in probability, though a comprehensive review is provided. No coding experience is assumed, but for those with truly no experience, a lighter schedule for the semester might be wise.
