    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nIn a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete."

I’m an applied statistician, data scientist and a professor of mathematics at Bowdoin College. In addition to teaching, I spend most of my time thinking about how different types of social science data (pottery sherds, election results, tweets) can be integrated to create complex portraits of social phenomena. I’m particularly interested in how statistical techniques from genetics and high-throughput biology can provide low-dimensional representations of persistent cultural features to address long-standing statistical complexities in the social sciences.\n\n\n\nAssociate Professor, Bowdoin College\nSenior Statistician, Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford\nResearch Associate in Statistical Genetics, University of Bristol\n\n\n\n\n\nBA, Pomona College (Mathematics)\nPhD, UCLA (Biomathematics)"

In practice this means we will be: (1) learning how to build statistical models; (2) learning how to interpret their results from real data sets, and (3) repeating that in as many contexts as we can possibly squeeze into a semester. We’ll take a galloping tour of many of the workhorses of computational statistics and machine learning: simulation, parametric models, inference, testing, regression (in its myriad forms), and clustering. Along the way, we’ll consider data from across the modern experience – university teaching evaluations, municipal hate crimes, speed dating experiments, astronomical surveys, criminal sentencing, immigration processes, the Atlantic slave trade, and the Titanic disaster – to give students wide exposure to different interpretive examples for squaring up statistical results with the complex, ambiguous messiness of human understanding. Through the semester, we will collaboratively fashion the tools each student will need to construct their final data project, the elaboration of a statistical model for a data set of their choosing. Course material very much assumes a course in probability, though a comprehensive review is provided. No coding experience is assumed, but for those with truly no experience, a lighter schedule for the semester might be wise."
