    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nIn a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete."

I’m an applied statistician, data scientist, and a professor of mathematics at Bowdoin College. In addition to teaching, I spend most of my time thinking about how mixture models can be used to analyze social science data (pottery sherds, election results, tweets) to create remarkably simple portraits of complex social phenomena. Recently, I have been thinking a lot about how to connect these methods to the Bayesian multiview problem: how to integrate multiple types of election and demographic information into a single model that simultaneously ascertains the relative contribution of each data type to the overall model?\n\n\n\nAssociate Professor, Bowdoin College (2018-present)\nSenior Statistician, Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford (2010-2012)\nResearch Associate in Statistical Genetics, University of Bristol (2008-2009)\n\n\n\n\n\nBA, Pomona College (Mathematics)\nPhD, UCLA (Biomathematics)"

Currently in press in Political Science Research and Methods.\n(Dec 2025) My two honors students, Avery Cutler and Nathan Kellerman, made absolutely amazing mid-year presentations on their respective projects. Check out their projects here: [Avery’s on modeling eviction records in Boston] and Nathan’s work on a new EM algorithm for overdispersed count data.\n(July 2025) Very happy to see Assistant Professor of Physics Fe McBride’s paper, “A radio-quiet AGN as a candidate counterpart to neutrino event IceCube–200615A” (on which I made a very small assist) published in The Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society."

Over the course of the semester, we’ll be: (1) learning how to build statistical models; (2) learning how to interpret their results from real data sets, and (3) repeating that in as many ways and contexts as we can possibly squeeze in during our time together. Consequently, we’ll be taking a brisk (but thorough!) tour of many of the workhorses of computational statistics: simulation, parametric models, testing, regression (in its myriad forms), model selection, and clustering. We’ll consider data from municipal hate crimes, speed dating experiments, astronomical surveys, criminal sentencing, immigration processes, and the Titanic disaster to give students an intensive exposure to the extraordinary power and many dangers of statistical reasoning.\nThough a comprehensive review is provided, the pace of the material very much assumes a previous course in probability. No coding experience is assumed but for those with truly no experience a lighter schedule for the semester might be wise. As a final project, students will present a set of models for a data set of their choosing."
